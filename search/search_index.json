Inferring Genome-Wide Interaction Networks Using the Phi-Mixing Coefficient This paper introduces a novel algorithm based on the \u03c6-mixing coefficient from probability theory to infer genome-wide interaction networks. The method allows for the construction of weighted and directed networks that can contain cycles, and it has been applied to study subtypes of lung cancer, including small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell (NSCLC), as well as normal lung tissue. 2. Finding Hierarchy in Directed Online Social Networks ^ The authors define a measure of hierarchy within directed online social networks and present an efficient algorithm to compute this measure. This work provides insights into the structural organization of social networks and how hierarchical relationships can be identified and quantified. oai_citation:0\u2021ACM Digital Library 3. Faster Way to Agony: Discovering Hierarchies in Directed Graphs ^ This paper presents an improved algorithm for computing \"agony,\" a metric used to quantify the hierarchical structure in directed graphs. The proposed method reduces the computational complexity from O(nm\u00b2) to O(m\u00b2), making it more practical for analyzing large-scale networks. oai_citation:1\u2021arXiv 4. Tiers for Peers: A Practical Algorithm for Discovering Hierarchy in Weighted Networks ^ Building upon the concept of agony, this study extends the approach to weighted networks and introduces constraints on the number of hierarchical levels. The authors connect the problem to the capacitated circulation problem and provide both exact and heuristic solutions, demonstrating efficiency in handling large datasets. 5. Reconstructing Directed Gene Regulatory Network by Only Gene Expression Data ^ The paper proposes the Context-Based Dependency Network (CBDN) method to reconstruct directed gene regulatory networks using solely gene expression data. This approach addresses the challenge of inferring regulatory directions without additional data, such as eQTLs or gene knock-out experiments, which are often unavailable for human tissue samples.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#agony","text":"Authors: James Bannon , Julia Nguyen , Matthew Boccalon , Jermiah Joseph Contact: bhklab.jermiahjoseph@gmail.com Description: Agony implementation","title":"Agony"},{"location":"#set-up","text":"","title":"Set Up"},{"location":"#prerequisites","text":"Pixi is required to run this project.

The CCLE dataset is very large, and kallisto is faster for quantifying large datasets 2. GDSC used kallisto, so we can compare our results with theirs Technical Challenges Record significant problems you encountered and how you solved them ## Sample Name Format Issue [2025-04-25] We encountered a problem with sample name formats between the CCLE and GDSC datasets. The CCLE dataset uses \"BRCA-XX-XXXX\" format, while the GDSC dataset uses \"BRCA-XX-XXXX-XX\". We had to write a script to remove the last two characters from the sample names in the GDSC dataset.
