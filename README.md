## Introduction

The notion of **graph agony** was developed out of a desire to find hierarchies in directed networks [[2]](#2). Intuitively, a hierarchy -- in an organization or social network, for example -- involves assigning *levels* or *ranks* to people such that the ranks are ordered. For example, the CEO of a company should rank higher than an intern. 

Agony works by trying to *find* a hierarchy that best reflects that structure of a given directed network. At a very high level the algorithms in [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3), and [[4]](#4) operate on the same way:

- **Input:**  A directed graph $G=(V,E)$.
- **Output:** A rank function $r^*:V\to \mathbb{N}$, and a value $A(G)$ that is the agony of the graph $G$.

The values of $r^*$ and $A(G)$ are found by solving the following minimization problem:

$$\underset{r:V\to\mathbb{N}}{\min}\sum_{(u,v)\in E}\max(0,r(u)-r(v)+1)$$

where $r^*$ is the function that minimizes the above sum and $A(G)$ is the value achieved.

## Immediate Next Steps

The most immediate next steps involve implementing the ability to compute the weighted and unweighted versions of agony as described in [[3]](#3) and [[4]](#4), respectively. We should do this at least in first in pure `python.` Below are some next steps along with tentative assignments to project members.

**TO DO:**
- Read over Tiers for Peers [[4]](#4) and define the most general form of the agony problem. (James)
- Re-write the linear program agony code such that it's more readable. (James)
- Write the `C++` code in `python` likely using the `heapq` module for the priority queue. `R` also has a [priority queue implemented](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/collections/versions/0.1.5/topics/PriorityQueue). (James, Jermiah, Matthew)
- De-bug and benchmark the `python` implementation against its `C++` counterpart. (Jermiah, Matthew)
- Investigate the weighted agony algorithm defined in [[4]](#4). (James, Jermiah, Matthew). The author of [[4]](#4) has made a [C++ implementation available](http://users.ics.aalto.fi/ntatti/agony.zip). The files are also in this repo in the `agony_cpp` folder. 


## Project Ideas

### Software Paper

If we can write a decent `python` and/or `R` package we can release it as its own software paper. It might be worth talking to Ben about this because it's not clear if re-writing publicly available code is a worthy paper. That said, making a library available publicly in pure `python` or `R` is maybe worth circulating/publishing as a matter of record. 

### Pharmacogenomics Papers

The way I see it, there are two ways that we can proceed with a PGx style paper. One way involves using the agony itself as a biomarker. The second involves using agony for rank aggregation.

##### Agony As A Biomarker

In the unweighted case, the agony is bounded above by $|E|$ and 
## Set Up

### Prerequisites

Pixi is required to run this project.
If you haven't installed it yet, [follow these instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Set up the environment using Pixi:

```bash
pixi install
```

### Usage

agony bindings are available in the `agony` module.

I've setup two tasks to showcase this

```console
pixi run help
